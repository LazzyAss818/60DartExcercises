# 60DartExcercises
Hi I'm LazzyAss818, I made this repository to help you practice and sharpen your basic dart skills. This is for both new learners as well as people with already good knowledge of the language.
I will keep updating the solutions folder daily.
The solutions folder contains solutions of problems that are mentioned in Excercises.txt.
Any suggestion will be appreciated.
Thank You!
